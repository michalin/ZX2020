This is the Arduino Sketch that writes the CP/M bootloader file `(bootldr.com)` directly into RAM and starts CP/M when finished. After that it serves as serial-USB converter for the serial disk emulation.
### Todo
Open the sketch with Arduino-IDE or any other IDE with AVM support and select *`Tools->Board->"Arduino Mega or Mega 2560`*.
