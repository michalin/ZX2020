ZASM - Z80 Opcode Assembler
---------------------------

ZASM is a fairly basic assembler for Z80 opcodes, along thelines of the ASM
assembler for 8080 opcodes. It takes a sourcefile in Z80 code, and assembles
it to an Intel hex file, whichcan then either be converted to an executable 
using the CP/MLOAD command, or blown to an eprom.

ZASM is a two pass assembler. 
During both passes the assemblyis listed to screen. On encountering an error a 
message ió displayed to the screen and the option of continuing orabandoning is 
offered.

ZASM is self hosting (it can assemble itself). Therefore thesource 
code provides a reasonable example of the syntax.

To use ZASM to assemble ZASM use the CP/M command:

ZASM ZASM.Z80

Syntax notes:

* Z80 Opcodes are standard.
* Numbers are decimal by default.
* Hex numbers are preceeded by a hash (#).
* Pseudo ops are:
  DEFB - Define bytes.
  DEFW - Define words.
  DEFS - Define strings.
  DEFC - Define strings terminated with high bit set.
  BYTE - Reserve space for specified number of bytes.
  WORD - Reserve space for specified number of words.
  ORG  - Set location for calculating address of labels.
  LOAD - Set address for code in hex file.
  INCLUDE - Insert contents of specified file at this location.
